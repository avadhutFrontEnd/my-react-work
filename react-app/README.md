[Course: 1. React 18 for Beginners > 6-Building Forms (71m) ] [ Video: #15-Extracting-the-User-Service_mp4_8min_22sec  ] -  `App.tsx` component is a little bit too concerned with making HTTP requests. So to improve this code, we should `extract all the logic around making HTTP requests into a separate service`. This allows us to separate concerns and make our code more modular and reusable.
